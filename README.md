# Voting App

### Hi!

My name is [Luke Walker](http://lukewalker.org), and I'm currently teaching myself to build cool things on the web by working through Free Code Camp's curriculum. [This site is a part of that.](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app)

It's my first full-stack Javascript site. I built it with Node/Express/MongoDB (using Clementine.js as boilerplate), with Passport.js for authentication, Swig for templates, Bootstrap to keep things looking decent, and Chart.js for beautiful charts, and [this palette generator from Google](https://github.com/google/palette.js/tree/master) for the color scheme.

You can play with my voting app on heroku here: https://ubershibs-voting-app.herokuapp.com

I'd love any feedback you have! Send along an email to luke dot walker at gmail dot com.

##Changes:
- 0.2 June 21, 2016
  - Added a "Register" button to clarify vs. single "Login" button
  - Refactored All Polls and individual poll pages, and the user profile page to include more content on initial pageload, reducing the number of AJAX calls.
  - Poll creators always see the results view of their polls (and as a result, can no longer vote on their own polls.)
- 0.1 Initial launch

## To-do:
- Move view logic entirely to Swig templates â€” completed for the index and poll views - and remove duplicative routes.
- Add more authentication options/local.
- Make things prettier.
- Maybe change voting to be one vote per poll per user/IP address (for guests), rather than one vote per poll per session? I've left it like this to facilitate testing for now.

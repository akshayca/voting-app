# Voting App

### Hi!

My name is [Luke Walker](http://lukewalker.org), and I'm currently teaching myself to build cool things on the web by working through Free Code Camp's curriculum. [This site is a part of that.](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-voting-app)

It's my first full-stack Javascript site. I built it with Node/Express/MongoDB (using Clementine.js as boilerplate), with Passport.js for authentication, Swig for templates, Bootstrap to keep things looking decent, and Chart.js for beautiful charts, and [this palette generator from Google](https://github.com/google/palette.js/tree/master) for the color scheme.

I'd love any feedback you have! Send along an email to luke dot walker at gmail dot com.

## To-do:
- Move view logic entirely to Swig templates â€” I had the site half built before I discovered the engine, so I'm not yet taking full advantage of its functionality.
- Add more authentication options/local.
- Make things prettier.
